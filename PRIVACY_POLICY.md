# Privacy Policy for Nothing Compass

**Last Updated: February 1, 2026**

Nothing Compass ("the App") is developed as an Open Source project by Yusuf İhsan Şimşek ("the Developer"). This Privacy Policy explains how information is handled within the App.

## 1. No Data Collection
Nothing Compass is designed to respect your privacy. The App does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data or usage information to the Developer or any third party. All calculations and sensor data processing occur entirely on your device.

## 2. Device Sensors and Location Data
- **Sensors**: The App uses your device's sensors (such as the magnetometer and accelerometer) to provide compass and inclinometer functionality. This sensor data is processed locally on your device in real-time.
- **Location**: If you enable "True North" features, the App may request access to your device's location to calculate magnetic declination. This location data is used only for calculation within the App, is processed locally, and is never uploaded, stored, or shared.

## 3. Permissions
- **Vibrate**: Used to provide haptic feedback to enhance the user experience. This can be disabled in the App settings.

## 4. Third-Party Services
The App may use the following third-party services which may collect information used to identify you:
- **Google Play Services**: Used for features such as In-App Reviews. Google's privacy policy applies: [Google Privacy & Terms](https://policies.google.com/privacy)
- **GitHub**: The App's source code is hosted on GitHub. If you visit the project page or report an issue, GitHub's privacy policy applies.

## 5. User-Initiated Communication
If you choose to contact the Developer for feedback, support, or to report an issue (e.g., via email or GitHub), the information you provide—including any diagnostic information generated by the App—will only be used to address your inquiry and improve the App.

## 6. Changes to This Privacy Policy
The Developer may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated "Last Updated" date.

## 7. Contact
If you have any questions or suggestions regarding this Privacy Policy, please contact the Developer at [ihsansimsek5335@gmail.com](mailto:ihsansimsek5335@gmail.com) or via the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/iso53/Nothing-Compass).
